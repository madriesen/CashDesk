# CashDesk
Cash desk application for pop-ups "mcDonalds style". The cashier set up the orders, the kitchen receives the orders and can mark them as done or deleted.

Setup can easily be done on a raspberry pi. For a test image for raspberry pi with cashdesk, send a mail to info@martijndriesen.me.
The rasberry pi creates a wifi network so you don't need an extra router, but you can use it if you want.
